One thing I would like to learn is adding an AI based program to put directions into that will produce a code. This could also help 
with fixing errors and adding comments. Another program that could be helpful is one that acts as a spell check that wouldn't 
autocorrect (incase something was intentionally misspelled) but would underline or highlight the word(s) being misspelled. 
Finally, a program teaching tool that would be step by step and would follow along with the learner. 
It would only move on to the next step if the learner wrote the code correctly.
