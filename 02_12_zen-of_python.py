A few things I learned from Zen of Python include that simple is better than complex.
You want your program to look as simple as possible for better understanding and less 
chance of anything going wrong in the code. Readability is also very important, 
not just for the actual interpreter but for programmers as well to be able to read and 
figure out what the code means. Finally, it is important to explain what your code is doing. 
This helps both you and other programmers help to understand the code. This also can help 
if you are returning to your code after a break and need a sense of guidance on what to do.
