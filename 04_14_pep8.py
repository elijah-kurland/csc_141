'''Here are a few things I learned while reviewing PEP: When using indentation, it is important to use 4 spaces per indented section. 
Use either tabs or spaces not because python won't respond correctly to it. It is mandatory to have no more than 80 characters 
per line of code and 79 should be the max amount. It is also important to avoid excessive white space so that your code is organized
but not stretched too far and take up unneeded space. Trailing commas are required when making a tuple of one element and should not 
appear in tuples of more than one. Keeping comments up to date with your code is important not only for you but other programmers
that read your code to understand what you are trying to accomplish. Finally, avoid using I and O as single letter variable names
since they could be recognized as the numbers 1 and 0 instead. To counter this, use the letter L.'''
