'''Now that I have more experience with coding and what it is capable of doing, I have thought about a few
ideas of how I want to use it in the future. First, I would like to create my own website for my photography.
It would show my techniques and would have a database of different dates to scroll through depending on when the 
photo was uploaded. Another idea I have is to make a game reminiscent of the Oregon Trail, but have it set in either
a fantasy or sci-fi world. It would have multiple text options to plug in and would respond accordingly. Finally, I 
would create a spell check system to use within VSC and Python. It wouldn't autocorrect but would underline any
misspelled words (specifically within comments).'''
